I'm Adrian, a designer with over 15 years' experience in both design and development.

I’ve worked in government, tech start-ups, computer game studios and large e-commerce retailers. I'm currently working at RBS, building a HR platform for business bank customers.

My day-to-day work is UX and UI design. From a UX perspective, I love getting involved in user testing and understanding the needs of different users in a digital product.

I’m also more than happy bringing these ideas to life in the UI, from early sketches up to high fidelity mocks.

My favourite way of working is to see a project from inception through to delivery and iterating often throughout the project lifecycle. I’m happiest seeing my ideas come to life through prototyping and validating these assumptions.

I still like to get involved with the build stage of the product, and often get my hands dirty in the code. There’s no better way to build prototypes and test user interactions, other than diving straight into the browser.
